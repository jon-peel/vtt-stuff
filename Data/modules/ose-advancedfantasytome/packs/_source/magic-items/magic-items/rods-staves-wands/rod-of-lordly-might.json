    "description": "<p>A thick metal rod with a spherical head and a set of 8 studs along the shaft. Pressing the studs activates a variety of magical and mundane effects.</p><ul><li><p><strong>Usage restriction:</strong> Only usable by non-spell casting martial characters (e.g. fighters).</p></li><li><p><strong>In combat:</strong> The rod may be wielded as a mace +2. If the wielder has a STR of less than 16, they suffer a –2 penalty to attack rolls, due to the rod’s weight.</p></li><li><p><strong>Studs:</strong> Have the following effects:</p><ol type=\"a\"><li><strong>Paralysis:</strong> A creature touched must <em><strong>save vs spells</strong></em> or be paralysed for 6 turns. This consumes one charge.</li><li><strong>Fear:</strong> Creatures within a 60’ cone (30’ wide at the end) must <em><strong>save versus spells</strong></em> or flee in terror for 10 rounds. This consumes one charge.</li><li><strong>Life drain:</strong> A creature hit with the rod in melee (requiring an attack roll) suffers [[/r 2d4]] damage. The wielder gains the same number of hit points (up to their normal maximum). This consumes one charge.</li><li><strong>Flaming sword +1:</strong> A flaming sword blade springs from the sphere, while the rod shortens to become the hilt. The sword casts light in a 30’ radius and may be used to set things on fire (treat as a torch). Against fire-unfavorable foes, its attack bonuses increases: +2 vs bird-like creatures and creatures which cannot regenerate fire damage; +3 vs plant-creatures and undead.</li><li><strong>Battle axe +3:</strong> An axe blade springs from the sphere, while the rod lengthens to become the handle.</li><li><strong>Spear +2:</strong> A blade springs from the sphere, while the rod lengthens into a 6’ long shaft.</li><li><strong>Ladder:</strong> The rod lengthens to up to 50’ long, with horizontal climbing bars along both sides and spikes at either end. Attached to a solid surface at each end, the rod can support up to 40,000 coins of weight.</li><li><strong>Orientation:</strong> The wielder gains immediate knowledge of their elevation above/below ground and which direction is north.</li></ol></li><li><p><strong>When all charges are expended:</strong> Studs a, b, c, d, and e no longer function.</p></li></ul>",
