Victims are completely helpless while held by the snake ([[/r 1d4]] turns, or released as the wielder of the staff commands).</p></li><li><p><strong>Snake:</strong> Has AC 5 [14], HD 3 (20hp), and a movement rate of 60’ (20’).</p></li><li><p><strong>When the victim is released:</strong> The snake returns to the owner and transforms back into a staff.
