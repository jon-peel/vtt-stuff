The hole then disappears from the surface it was placed on.</p></li><li><p><strong>Anything inside the hole:</strong> Remains in an extra-dimensional space when the cloth is picked up.</p></li><li><p><strong>Living creatures in the hole:</strong> Can unfold the cloth (if they have it) to recreate the hole at its last location. The hole contains enough air for one turn.</p></li></ul>",
