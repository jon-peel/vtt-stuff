The flask—if the appropriate command word is used—has the power to trap an extra-planar being and force it into servitude.</p><ul><li><p><strong>When found:</strong> There is a [[/br 1d100]]{50%} chance that a creature (e.g. an elemental, djinni, efreeti, invisible stalker, or other creature of extra-planar origin) is already trapped in the flask.</p></li><li><p><strong>Removing the plug:</strong> Frees the trapped creature (if any). If the character speaks the command word, the creature is forced to serve for 1 turn. If the command word is not spoken, the creature’s reaction should be determined randomly (see Monster Reactions under Encounters in the Advanced Fantasy Player’s Tome).</p></li><li><p><strong>Trapping creatures:</strong> If the flask is empty, an extra-planar creature within 60’ can be trapped by removing the plug and speaking the command word. The creature may <strong>save versus spells</strong> to resist. If the creature was previously trapped in the flask, it gains a +2 bonus to the save and becomes utterly hostile.</p></li></ul>",
