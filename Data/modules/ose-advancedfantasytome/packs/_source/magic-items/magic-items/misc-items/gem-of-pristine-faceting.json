Affected gems increase in value by 50%.</p></li><li><p><strong>Charges:</strong> The gem has [[/r 10d10]] charges. One charge is used each time it transforms another gem.</p></li><li><p><strong>Facets:</strong> The gem has as many facets as it has charges. Each time a charge is spent, it loses one facet. When all charges have been spent, it becomes a worthless stone sphere.</p></li></ul>",
