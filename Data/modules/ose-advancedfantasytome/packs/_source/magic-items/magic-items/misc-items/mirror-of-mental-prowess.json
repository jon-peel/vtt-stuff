The clarity of the vision is dependant on the scryer’s familiarity with the subject. It is not possible to cast spells through the mirror into the viewed scene.</p></li><li><p><strong>Dimensional travel:</strong> When scrying, the character may choose to step into the mirror, appearing in the observed location. This works the same as the 6th level illusionist spell <em>@UUID[Compendium.ose-advancedfantasytome.spells.Item.xQl6mCOSSrauornU]{through the looking glass}</em>.</p></li><li><p><strong>Questions:</strong> Once per week, a short question about a creature whose reflection is viewed in the mirror.
