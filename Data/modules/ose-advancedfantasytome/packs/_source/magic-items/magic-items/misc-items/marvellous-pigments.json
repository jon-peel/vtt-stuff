    "description": "<p>Pots of magical paint which can be applied to a flat surface to conjure a real, three-dimensional object. [[/r 1d4]] pots of pigment are usually found together, along with a brush.</p><ul><li><p><strong>Applying:</strong> The object to be conjured must be painted onto a flat surface (e.g. wall, door, floor, ceiling). The artistic skill of the character has no bearing—the object magically flows from the paint brush, guided by the character’s imagination alone.</p></li><li><p><strong>Time:</strong> Painting an object takes 1 turn.</p></li><li><p><strong>Dimensions:</strong> Each pot of the pigments is sufficient to cover a 10’ × 10’ surface, conjuring an object of up to 1,000 cubic feet (e.g. 10’ × 10’ × 10’).</p></li><li><p><strong>Type of objects:</strong> Only non-magical, inanimate things may be conjured, for example: rooms, portals, armour, equipment, trees, flowers, pits, passages, etc.</p></li><li><p><strong>Valuable objects:</strong> May be conjured. These appear valuable, but are actually constructed of low value materials (e.g. tin, glass, etc.).</p></li><li><p><strong>Duration:</strong> Conjured objects are permanent and real in every sense.</p></li></ul>",
