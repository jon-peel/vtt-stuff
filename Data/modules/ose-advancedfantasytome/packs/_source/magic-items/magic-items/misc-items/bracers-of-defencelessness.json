Any bonuses due to DEX or other magical protections are negated.</p></li><li><p><strong>Removing:</strong> Once the curse is active, the character cannot remove the bracers. The curse can only be removed by magic (e.g. <em>@UUID[Compendium.ose-advancedfantasytome.spells.Item.zXFADd6L1nzS6uzq]{remove curse}</em>).</p></li></ul>",
