    "description": "<p>A visual illusion of the caster’s choosing manifests in a 20′ cube area. Three types of illusions may be created:</p><ol><li><strong>An illusionary monster:</strong> That can be directed to attack. The monster has Armour Class of 9 [10] and will vanish if hit in combat.</li><li><strong>An illusionary attack:</strong> For example, an avalanche, a falling ceiling, a magic missile, etc. Targets who <em><strong>save versus spells</strong></em> are unaffected.</li><li><strong>A scene:</strong> Either changing the appearance of the affected area or creating the appearance of something new. The scene disappears if touched.</li></ol><p><strong>Stipulations:</strong> The following apply:</p><ul><li><strong>Concentration:</strong> Is required to maintain the illusion. If the caster moves or loses concentration, the spell ends.</li><li><strong>Illusionary monsters or attacks:</strong> May appear to be harmful but no real damage is ever inflicted. A character who appears to die actually falls unconscious, a character turned to stone will actually be paralysed, and so on. Such effects last for [[/r 1d4]] turns.</li><li><strong>Illusions from imagination:</strong> If the illusion is of something the caster has not personally seen, the referee should grant targets a bonus to any applicable saving throws.</li></ul>",
