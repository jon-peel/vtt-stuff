The subject gains a +4 bonus to AC and saving throws against attacks from such opponents.</p></li><li><p><strong>Equipment:</strong> Any gear the subject is carrying is also rendered invisible (this includes clothing and armour). Items dropped or put down by an invisible creature become visible.</p></li><li><p><strong>Light sources:</strong> If a light source is made invisible (as part of the subject’s gear), the light it casts is unaffected.</p></li></ul>",
