The pattern drifts at a rate of 30’ per round and fades after [[/r 1d4]] rounds. Hypnotised creatures will do their best to follow the pattern, but if they are led into a dangerous area, another <strong>saving throw versus spells</strong> is allowed to snap out of the trance.</p></li></ul></li></ul>",
