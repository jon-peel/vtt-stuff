    "description": "<p>An illusion of the caster’s choosing— including sounds, smells, and thermal elements—manifests in a 20’ cube area. Three types of illusions may be created:</p><ol><li><p><strong>An illusionary monster:</strong> That can be directed to attack. The monster has AC 5 [14]. If it is hit in combat, the attacker may save versus spells. If the save succeeds, the attacker realises the illusory nature of the monster and can no longer be harmed by it.</p></li><li><p><strong>An illusionary attack:</strong> For example, an avalanche, a falling ceiling, a magic missile, etc. Targets who save versus spells are unaffected.</p></li><li><p><strong>A scene:</strong> Either changing the appearance of the affected area or creating the appearance of something new.</p></li></ol><p><strong>Stipulations:</strong> The following apply:</p><ul><li><p><strong>Responsiveness:</strong> The illusion behaves and responds as decided by the caster when the spell is cast. No concentration is required to maintain the illusion.</p></li><li><p><strong>Illusionary monsters or attacks:</strong> May appear to be harmful but never inflict real damage. A character who appears to die actually falls unconscious, a character turned to stone will actually be paralysed, and so on. Such effects last for [[/r 1d4]] turns.</p></li><li><p><strong>Illusions from imagination:</strong> If the illusion is of something the caster has not personally seen, the referee should grant targets a bonus to any applicable saving throws.</p></li></ul>",
