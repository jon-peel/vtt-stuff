It may include conditions on the enchanted object being touched or on the presence of creatures within 30’ of the object. The trigger condition may only take visual appearances into account (e.g. it cannot discern the alignment, class, level, etc. of creatures who pass by).</p></li><li><p><strong>Once triggered:</strong> The mouth appears, animates, and speaks the predetermined message. The enchantment then ends.</p></li><li><p><strong>Casting spells:</strong> The triggered message cannot cast spells.</p></li></ul>",
