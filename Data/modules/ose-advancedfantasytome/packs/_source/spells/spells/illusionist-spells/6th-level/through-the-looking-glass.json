The portal is invisible, but may be perceived by the caster or by magic.</p></li><li><p><strong>Stepping back through:</strong> Anyone who perceives the portal may step out of the mirror and into the location whence the caster originated.</p></li></ul></li><li><p><strong>At the end of the spell’s duration:</strong> The portal disappears. Any creature (including the caster) that stepped through the portal/mirror and did not return must save versus death or becomes lost in another plane of reality.</p></li></ul><p><strong>Material cost:</strong> The mirror must be of at least 5,000gp value.</p>",
