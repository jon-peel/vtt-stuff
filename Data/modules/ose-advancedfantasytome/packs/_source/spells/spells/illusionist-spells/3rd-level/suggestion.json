If the save fails, the subject will follow the caster’s suggestion for up to the duration.</p></li><li><p><strong>Reasonable suggestions:</strong> A suggestion that is worded in a way to make it sound very reasonable incurs a –2 penalty to the saving throw.</p></li></ul><p><strong>Restrictions:</strong> Undead are unaffected.</p>",
