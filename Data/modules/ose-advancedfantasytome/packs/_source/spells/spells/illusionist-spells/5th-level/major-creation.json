For example, a sword could be formed from a splinter of steel.</p><ul><li><p><strong>Non-living:</strong> Only objects of non-living vegetable or mineral matter may be created (e.g. fabric, rope, wood, metal, stone, etc.).</p></li><li><p><strong>Size:</strong> The object may be no larger than one cubic foot per level of the caster.</p></li><li><p><strong>Food:</strong> While it is possible to create food, its semi-real nature means that it provides no nourishment.</p></li><li><p><strong>Duration:</strong> If objects of vegetable matter are created, the duration is 12 turns per level, otherwise it is 6 turns per level.</p></li><li><p><strong>When the duration ends:</strong> The conjured item disappears. The piece of matter from which it was woven remains.</p></li></ul>",
