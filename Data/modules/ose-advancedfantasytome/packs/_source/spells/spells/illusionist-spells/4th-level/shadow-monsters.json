To this subject, the shadow monsters have AC 9 [10] and inflict one quarter of their normal damage (rounding down). This subject is unaffected by any special or magical attack forms of the monsters.</p></li><li><p><strong>If the save fails:</strong> The subject perceives the monsters as real creatures of the chosen type. To this subject, the shadow monsters attack as normal and inflict normal damage. They may use any special or magical attack forms they possess, but attacks such as energy drain or petrification do not really occur—at worst, they might cause an opponent to fall unconscious or be paralysed for [[/r 1d4]] turns.</p></li></ul></li></ul>",
