    "description": "<p>All creatures in a 40’ square area within range must <strong>save versus spells</strong> or be afflicted by an emotion of the caster’s choosing:</p><ul><li><p><strong>Fear:</strong> Subjects are struck with terror and will flee from the caster at maximum speed. Affected creatures have a 60% chance of immediately dropping anything in their hands. The chance is decreased by 5% for each level or Hit Die above 1. Fear counters ongoing rage effects.</p></li><li><p><strong>Hate:</strong> Subjects gain a +2 bonus to attacks, damage, saving throws, and morale. Hate counters ongoing hopelessness effects.</p></li><li><p><strong>Hopelessness:</strong> Subjects are utterly demoralised and will dejectedly follow enemies’ orders (e.g. to surrender or leave). In combat, there is a [[/r 1d4]]{1-in-4} chance of a subject doing nothing each round, and a [[/r 1d4]]{1-in-4} chance of them retreating. Hopelessness counters ongoing hate effects.</p></li><li><p><strong>Rage:</strong> Subjects go berserk, gaining a +1 bonus to hit and +3 to damage. Subjects fight without thought for their own lives and will not use shields. Subjects also gain 5 temporary hit points. These may take a subject above its normal maximum, but disappear when the spell ceases. Rage counters ongoing fear effects.</p></li></ul><p><strong>Concentration:</strong> Is required to maintain the projected emotion. If the caster moves or loses concentration, the spell ends.</p>",
