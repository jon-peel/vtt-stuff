    "description": "<p>An illusion of the caster’s choosing— including minor sounds (though not speech)—manifests in a 20’ cube area. Three types of illusions may be created:</p><ol><li><p><strong>An illusionary monster:</strong> That can be directed to attack. The monster has an Armour Class of 7 [12] and will vanish if hit in combat.</p></li><li><p><strong>An illusionary attack:</strong> For example, an avalanche, a falling ceiling, a magic missile, etc. Targets who <strong>save versus spells</strong> are unaffected.</p></li><li><p><strong>A scene:</strong> Either changing the appearance of the affected area or creating the appearance of something new. The scene disappears if touched.</p></li></ol><p><strong>Stipulations:</strong> The following apply:</p><ul><li><p><strong>Concentration:</strong> Is required to maintain the illusion. If the caster moves at faster than half speed or loses concentration, the spell ends.</p></li><li><p><strong>Persistence:</strong> Even when the caster stops concentrating on the spell, the illusion persists for two further rounds.</p></li><li><p><strong>Illusionary monsters or attacks:</strong> May appear to be harmful but never inflict real damage. A character who appears to die actually falls unconscious, a character turned to stone will actually be paralysed, and so on. Such effects last for [[/r 1d4]] turns.</p></li><li><p><strong>Illusions from imagination:</strong> If the illusion is of something the caster has not personally seen, the referee should grant targets a bonus to any applicable saving throws.</p></li></ul>",
