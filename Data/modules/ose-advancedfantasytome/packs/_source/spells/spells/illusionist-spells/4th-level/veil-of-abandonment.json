Even then, an observer must make a <strong>saving throw versus spells</strong> to realise that the whole area is under the effects of an illusion: if the save fails, the observer believes that the detected object is merely invisible.</p></li><li><p><strong>Creatures passing through the area:</strong> Believe that their passing makes footprints in the dust, breaks through cobwebs, etc.</p></li><li><p><strong>Detection:</strong> Creatures that can detect invisible cannot see through this illusion.</p></li></ul>",
