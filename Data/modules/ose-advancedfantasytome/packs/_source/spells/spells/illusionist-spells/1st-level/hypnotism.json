The number of creatures affected is determined after the suggestion is made.</p></li><li><p><strong>Wording:</strong> The suggestion must take the form of a short phrase (at most one or two sentences) suggesting a course of action to the subjects.</p></li><li><p><strong>Comprehension:</strong> A language that is understood by the subjects must be used.</p></li><li><p><strong>Harmful suggestions:</strong> A suggested course of action that is obviously harmful to a subject causes the spell to automatically fail for that subject.</p></li><li><p><strong>Saving throw:</strong> Each subject may <em><strong>save versus spells</strong></em> to resist the hypnotic suggestion. If the save fails, the subject will follow the caster’s suggestion for up to the duration of the spell.</p></li><li><p><strong>Reasonable suggestions:</strong> A suggestion that is worded in such a way to make it sound very reasonable incurs a –2 penalty to the saving throw.</p></li></ul><p><strong>Restrictions:</strong> Undead are not affected by hypnotism.</p>",
