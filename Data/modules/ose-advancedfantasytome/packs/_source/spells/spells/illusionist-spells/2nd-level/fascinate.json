Each time a request is made of the subject, the caster must make a CHA check (possibly penalised, if the request is against the nature or best interests of the subject). If the check fails, the spell is broken and the target’s perception of the caster becomes one of horror, rage, and hate.</p></li><li><p><strong>Animals:</strong> An animal remains fascinated for [[/r 1d4]] days, after which it may either attack the caster (if it has been mistreated) or simply leave. If the caster treated the animal well, there is a percentage chance equal to the caster’s CHA that the animal will henceforth remain by the character’s side of its own free will.</p></li></ul>",
