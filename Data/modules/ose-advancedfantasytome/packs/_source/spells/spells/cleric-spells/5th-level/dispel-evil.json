Each monster may <strong>save versus spells</strong> to avoid banishment or destruction. If a monster’s save succeeds, it flees the affected area.</p></li><li><p><strong>Target single monster:</strong> Instantly banish or destroy a single enchanted or undead monster within range. The monster may <strong>save versus spells </strong>(<strong>with a –2 penalty</strong>) to avoid banishment or destruction. If the monster’s save succeeds, it flees the affected area.</p></li><li><p><strong>Dispel curse:</strong> Instantly dispel the hold that a cursed item has over a being within range.</p></li></ol>",
