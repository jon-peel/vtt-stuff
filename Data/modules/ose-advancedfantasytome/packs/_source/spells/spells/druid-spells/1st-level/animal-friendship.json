    "description": "<p>The caster approaches a neutral-aligned beast of animal intelligence with a piece of food that it finds attractive. The animal must <strong>save versus spells</strong>:</p><ul><li><p><strong>If the save succeeds:</strong> The animal is not affected by the magic and behaves normally.</p></li><li><p><strong>If the save fails:</strong> The animal waits quietly while the caster performs a binding ritual lasting 6 turns.</p></li></ul><p>Once the binding is complete. The animal behaves as follows:</p><ul><li><p><strong>Follow:</strong> It will follow the caster wherever they go.</p></li><li><p><strong>Leaving the animal:</strong> The animal will not harm the caster, but if it is left alone for more than three days during the first three months, it reverts to its natural behaviour, ending the spell.</p></li><li><p><strong>Training:</strong> During the first three months, the animal may be trained to perform up to six simple tricks (depending on its intelligence). Each trick takes one week to train.</p></li></ul><p><strong>Maximum animal companions:</strong> Up to 2HD of animals per level of the caster may be befriended by this spell at any one time.</p>",
