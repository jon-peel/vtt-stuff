A javelin, magic wand, or spear counts as two arrows; a bow, club, or staff counts as four.</p></li><li><p><strong>Objects of other shapes:</strong> (e.g. boards or planks) of roughly equivalent size may also be targeted.</p></li><li><p><strong>Magical objects:</strong> That are targeted have a chance of being unaffected:</p><ul><li><p><strong>Magic weapons and arms:</strong> Have a 10% chance of being unaffected per magical “plus”. (e.g. a magical spear +2 has a 20% chance of being unaffected by warp wood.)</p></li><li><p><strong>Wielding:</strong> If the magical object is in the hands of a creature, the creature may also <strong>save versus spells</strong> to prevent the object being warped.</p></li></ul></li></ul>",
