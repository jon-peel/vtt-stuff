    "description": "<p>Poisons affecting the subject are dramatically slowed, giving the caster time to effect a full cure.</p><ul><li><p><strong>Poison effects:</strong> As long as the subject has more than 1 hit point, the slowed poison inflicts 1hp of damage per turn. If the subject is at 1hp, the poison inflicts no further damage.</p></li><li><p><strong>Characters killed by poison:</strong> Can be revived by this spell. Death must have occurred within one turn per level of the caster.</p></li><li><p><strong>Natural poisons:</strong> If the subject was poisoned by a natural plant or animal, the caster has a 10% chance per level of knowing a herbal antidote that will fully neutralize the poison. In the wilderness, gathering the herbs for the antidote takes one turn. In a settlement, the herbs may be available for purchase from a herbalist.</p></li><li><p><strong>When the duration ends:</strong> The full effects of the poison occur. If the subject was revived from death by this spell, they die once more</p></li></ul>",
