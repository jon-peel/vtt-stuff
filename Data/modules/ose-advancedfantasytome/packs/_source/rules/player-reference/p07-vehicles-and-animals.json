Analogous to a character’s hit points. A vehicle that reaches 0 hull points is destroyed.</p><hr style=\"visibility:hidden;margin:.5em 0\" /><p><strong>Armour Class (AC)</strong></p><p>The vehicle’s ability to resist damage from attacks.</p><hr style=\"visibility:hidden;margin:.5em 0\" /><p><strong>Movement Rate</strong></p><p>The speed at which the vehicle can move. Every vehicle has a base movement rate and an encounter movement rate (noted in parentheses). The encounter movement rate is one third of the base movement rate.</p><hr style=\"visibility:hidden;margin:.5em 0\" /><p><strong>Cargo Capacity</strong></p><p>The maximum load the vehicle can carry, measured in coins (see @UUID[Compendium.ose-advancedfantasytome.rules.JournalEntry.u9gtXY21VnjrwwkH.JournalEntryPage.nRk895vQvT8AuWZ5]{Time, Weight, and Movement}).</p><hr style=\"visibility:hidden;margin:.5em 0\" /><p><strong>Required Crew</strong></p><p>The number of people or animals (e.g. sailors, oarsmen, horses) required for the vehicle’s normal operation.</p><hr style=\"visibility:hidden;margin:.5em 0\" /><p><strong>Passengers or Mercenaries</strong></p><p>Some vehicles have extra space aboard specifically intended to carry passengers or mercenaries (of any type, see @UUID[Compendium.ose-advancedfantasytome.rules.JournalEntry.r9gEFXti3Vox9BTA.JournalEntryPage.sY8MkOu90iRf4gJo]{Mercenaries}) in addition to the normal crew. If a vehicle’s description does not mention this space for passengers, it is assumed to only have space for the crew—the referee may rule that cargo hold space could be converted into additional living quarters.</p><hr style=\"visibility:hidden;margin:.5em 0\" /><p><strong>Seaworthiness</strong></p><p>Water vessels are divided into two categories, each behaving differently under different wind conditions (see @UUID[Compendium.ose-advancedfantasytome.rules.JournalEntry.u9gtXY21VnjrwwkH.JournalEntryPage.9Pu7DvFdpiwXR2D8#wind-conditions]{Wind Conditions}). Seaworthy vessels are suitable for use on the high seas, away from coastal waters. Unseaworthy vessels are restricted to rivers, lakes, or coastal waters.</p><hr style=\"visibility:hidden;margin:.5em 0\" /><h2>Damaging Vehicles</h2><p>In combat, attacks and damage may be directed at vehicles in addition to characters and monsters.</p><hr style=\"visibility:hidden;margin:.5em 0\" /><p><strong>Normal attacks</strong>: Unless noted in a vehicle’s description, attacks with normal weapons (e.g. bows, swords, etc.) do not inflict hull damage.</p><hr style=\"visibility:hidden;margin:.5em 0\" /><p><strong>Magical attacks</strong>: Damaging spells or magical attacks inflict one point of hull damage per five points of normal hit point damage the attack does.</p><hr style=\"visibility:hidden;margin:.5em 0\" /><p><strong>Giant monsters</strong>: Can damage vehicles, inflicting one point of hull damage per five points of normal hit point damage the attack does.</p><hr style=\"visibility:hidden;margin:.5em 0\" /><p><strong>Mounted weaponry</strong>: Some vehicles carry mounted weaponry specifically designed for vehicle-to-vehicle combat. Such weapons inflict hull damage directly. The rules for attacking with ship-mounted weapons are described in @UUID[Compendium.ose-advancedfantasytome.rules.JournalEntry.LbHe6XO6WBsfDseJ.JournalEntryPage.qtL0RGRgkqWoAvwh]{Water Vessels}.</p><h2>Effects of Hull Damage</h2><p>When a vehicle loses hull points, its movement rate is also affected. This may be due to structural damage influencing how the vehicle moves or, in the case of water vessels, due to taking on water.</p><p>Movement rate reduction: For every 10% a vehicle is reduced from its maximum hull points, its movement rate is reduced by an equal percentage. For example, if a vehicle loses 20% of its hull points, its movement rate is reduced by 20%.</p><h3>Destruction</h3><p>If a vehicle is reduced to 0 hull points:</p><ul><li><p>It will lose its structural integrity in [[/r 1d10]] rounds (e.g. a water vessel sinks).</p></li><li><p>Any mounted weaponry is no longer functional.</p></li></ul><h3>Repairs</h3><p><strong>In a workshop:</strong> Vehicle damage can be repaired by experienced technicians working in a suitable workshop or dock.</p><p><strong>In the field:</strong> A vehicle’s crew can repair up to half of any damage sustained. Remaining damage can only be repaired in a suitable workshop or dock.</p><p><strong>Time:</strong> It takes five crew-members one turn to repair one hull point. This task requires full attention, so any crew involved in repair cannot take any other action during a turn repairing a vessel.</p><h2>Boarding</h2><p>When the occupants of a vehicle wish to board another vehicle, the two vehicles must be brought alongside one another.</p><p><strong>Forceful boarding</strong>: If the occupants of one vehicle wish to forcefully board the other vehicle, there is a [[/r 1d6]]{2-in-6} chance of being able to successfully manoeuvre the vehicle into a boarding position. The two vehicles may then be clamped together with grappling hooks.</p><p><strong>Mutual boarding intent</strong>: If the occupants of both vehicles wish to board one another, their mutual intent makes the action succeed with no chance of failure.</p><p><strong>Boarding characters</strong>: Characters who are in the act of boarding another vehicle suffer a –2 penalty to attack rolls and Armour Class for one round.</p><h2>Rowed Water Vessels</h2><h3>Rowing Encounter Speeds</h3><p>Some rowed vessels may have an increased encounter movement rate. This represents the great effort on the part of the oarsmen that may be exerted during combat. Such speeds cannot be maintained for long periods, thus the per turn and per day movement rates of such vessels are much slower.</p><h3>Reduced Oarsmen</h3><p>Having less than the required number of oarsmen reduces a vessel’s speed.</p><p><strong>Movement rate reduction</strong>: For every 10% reduction in the available rowing crew, the vessel’s rowing speed is reduced by an equal percentage. For example, if 10% of the oarsmen are being used to repair hull damage, the vessel moves at 90% of its normal speed (i.e. 10% slower than normal).</p>"

A small ship usually has 1–2 lifeboats, while larger ships may have 3–4. A lifeboat weighs 5,000 coins and reduces the cargo capacity of the ship on which it is carried by this much. A lifeboat is usually equipped with rations to feed ten human-sized beings for one week.</p><hr style=\"visibility:hidden;margin:1em 0\" /><p><strong>Longship</strong>: A narrow ship which may be used in rivers, coastal waters, or the open seas. A longship may be rowed or sailed, depending on the conditions. The crew typically fill the role of oarsmen, sailors, and fighters, as needed.</p><hr style=\"visibility:hidden;margin:1em 0\" /><p><strong>Sailing ship, large</strong>: A large, seaworthy vessel with up to three masts. Usually has multiple decks and raised “castles” at the bow and stern.</p><hr style=\"visibility:hidden;margin:1em 0\" /><p><strong>Sailing ship, small</strong>: A small, seaworthy vessel with a single mast.</p><hr style=\"visibility:hidden;margin:1em 0\" /><p><strong>Troop transport (large, small)</strong>: These ships have similar dimensions and characteristics to normal sailing ships, but are specially designed to carry troops, mounts, and equipment of war as theircargo.</p><hr style=\"visibility:hidden;margin:1em 0\" /><p><strong>Warship (large, small)</strong>: These ships have similar dimensions and characteristics to normal sailing ships, but are specially designed to carry mercenaries and war gear.</p><hr style=\"visibility:hidden;margin:1em 0\" /><p><strong>Boat, river</strong>: Riverboats are either rowed or pushed with poles. The cost of the boat increases by 1,000gp if it has a roof (to protect passengers or cargo).</p><hr style=\"visibility:hidden;margin:1em 0\" /><p><strong>Boat, sailing</strong>: A small boat typically used for fishing in lakes or coastal waters.</p><hr style=\"visibility:hidden;margin:1em 0\" /><p><strong>Canoe</strong>: A small boat made of hide or canvas stretched over a wooden frame. Because of its small size and lightweight construction, a canoe may be carried by two people (weighing 500 coins).</p><hr style=\"visibility:hidden;margin:1em 0\" /><p><strong>Galley, large</strong>: A long ship with a shallow draft and a single, square-sailed mast.</p><hr style=\"visibility:hidden;margin:1em 0\" /><p><strong>Galley, small</strong>: A ship with a shallow draft and a single, square-sailed mast.</p><hr style=\"visibility:hidden;margin:1em 0\" /><p><strong>Galley, war</strong>: A large, specially constructed galley that is generally a fleet’s flagship. War galleys are always fitted with a ram (comes with the basic cost) and have a full deck above the rowers. They have two masts and 10’–20’ wide wooden towers rising 15’–20’ above the bow and stern.</p><hr style=\"visibility:hidden;margin:1em 0\" /><p><strong>Raft, makeshift</strong>: Given sufficient wood, characters may build a makeshift raft in 1–3 days per 10’ square section (up to a maximum size of 20’ × 30’).</p><hr style=\"visibility:hidden;margin:1em 0\" /><p><strong>Raft, professional</strong>: A professionally built raft has raised sides, a basic steering oar, and some form of shelter for goods or passengers. Such a raft may be up to 30’ × 40’. Professionally built rafts are sometimes floated downstream with cargo and then broken down and sold for the value of their wood (25cp per square foot).</p><hr /><h4>Vessel Dimensions</h4><p>A ship’s beam is its width and its draft is the depth it extends beneath the water.</p><hr /><h4>Historical Periods</h4><p>The vessels described in this section span various historical periods, from the ancient period to the medieval.
