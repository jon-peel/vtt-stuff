    "description": "<p>See @UUID[Compendium.ose-advancedfantasytome.rules.JournalEntry.EUNZ2PDKp7Amu7CX]{Magic} for full details on arcane magic.</p>\n<p><strong>Magical research</strong>: A magic-user of any level may spend time and money on magical research. This allows them to add new spells to their spell book and to research other magical effects. When a magic-user reaches 9th level, they are also able to create magic items.</p>\n<p><strong>Spell casting</strong>: Magic-users carry spell books containing the formulae for arcane spells. The spell casting chart (opposite) shows both the number of spells in the magic-user&rsquo;s spell book and the number they may memorize, determined by the character&rsquo;s experience level. Thus, a 1st level magic-user has one spell in their spell book, selected by the referee (who may allow the player to choose). The list of spells available to magic-users is found @UUID[Compendium.ose-advancedfantasytome.rules.JournalEntry.EUNZ2PDKp7Amu7CX.JournalEntryPage.dat23W4Kv02OGyAJ]{Here}.</p>\n<p><strong>Using magic items</strong>: As spell casters, magic-users are able to use magic scrolls of spells on their spell list. They can also use items that may only be used by arcane spell casters (e.g. magic wands).</p>",
