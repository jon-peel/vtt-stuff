So long as the cleric is currently in favour with their god, a stronghold may be bought or built at half the normal price, due to divine intervention.</p>\n<p>Once a stronghold is established, the cleric will attract followers ([[/r 5d6 * 10]] fighters of level 1–2). These troops are completely devoted to the cleric, never checking morale. The referee decides which proportions of followers are 1st and 2nd level and which are bowmen, infantry, etc.</p>",
