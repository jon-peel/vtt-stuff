Dwarves usually live in clans, so dwarves of the character&rsquo;s clan will be attracted to live under their roof. Dwarves from other clans will generally be friendly and clans may collaborate in times of war or disaster. A dwarf ruler may only hire dwarven mercenaries. Specialists and retainers of any race may be hired.</p>",
