    "description": "<p>Knights are bound by a stringent code of honour, which they strive to uphold in all their deeds. A knight does not earn any experience points for deeds performed at odds with this code. The fundamentals of this code are: preference of death over dishonour; service of the knight&rsquo;s liege as the greatest honour; glory in single combat; defence to the death of any in the knight&rsquo;s charge; honouring of superiors; respect of equals; demanding obedience from inferiors; scorning the ignoble.</p>\n<p><strong>Dishonour</strong>: A knight who brings dishonour upon themselves or their liege (this may include changing alignment) may have their knighthood revoked. In this case, the character becomes a fighter of equivalent level. It may be possible to regain the status of knighthood by performing a special quest.</p>",
