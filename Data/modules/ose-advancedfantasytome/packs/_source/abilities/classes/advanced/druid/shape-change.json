The animal may be of any size up to around twice the bulk of the druid’s normal form. If a druid has lost hit points, they regain [[/r 1d4]] hit points per level upon changing into an animal. All equipment carried by the druid is absorbed into the animal form and reappears when the druid changes back.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>",
