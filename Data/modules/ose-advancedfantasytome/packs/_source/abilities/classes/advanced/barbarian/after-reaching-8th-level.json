The warriors are 1st level fighters with basic combat gear and may be mounted if customary in their culture. A horde can only be mustered for a specific purpose (e.g. attacking an enemy city, rescuing hostages, etc.). Once the purpose is achieved or abandoned, the horde disbands. Mustering a horde takes one week, and it remains for one week per level of the barbarian.</p>",
