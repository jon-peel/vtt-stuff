    "description": "<p>See @UUID[Compendium.ose-advancedfantasytome.rules.JournalEntry.EUNZ2PDKp7Amu7CX]{Magic} for full details on Arcane Magic.</p><p><strong>Spell casting</strong>: From 2nd level, half-elves gain the ability to cast arcane spells, owning a spell book in which the magical formulae for the spells they know are recorded. The level progression table (@UUID[Compendium.ose-advancedfantasytome.rules.JournalEntry.pKRzPpWFHma1Xfnx.JournalEntryPage.qEHpv3owi6iUKT3v#after-reaching-9th-level]{Half - Elf Level Progression}) shows both the number of spells in the half-elf’s spell book and the number they may memorize, determined by the character’s experience level. Thus, a 2nd level half-elf has one spell in their spell book, selected by the referee (who may allow the player to choose). The list of spells available to half-elves is provided in Cleric and Magic-User Spells (half-elves have the same spell selection as magic-users).</p><p><strong>Using magic items</strong>: As spell casters, half-elves are able to use magic scrolls of spells on their spell list. They can also use items that may only be used by arcane spell casters (e.g. magic wands).</p>",
