Bards who fall from favour with their deity may incur penalties.</p>\n<p><strong>Spell casting</strong>: Once a bard has proven their faith (from 2nd level), the character may pray to receive spells. The power and number of spells available to a bard are determined by experience level. The list of spells available to bards is found in Druid and Illusionist Spells (bards have the same spell selection as druids).</p>\n<p><strong>Using magic items</strong>: As spell casters, bards can use magic scrolls of spells on their spell list. They may also use any items that only druids can use.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>",
